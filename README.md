# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

# Introduction
This repository explores the crucial phase of Requirement Analysis in the software development lifecycle. It covers the process of gathering, analyzing, and documenting the functional and non-functional requirements needed to build successful software solutions. Whether you're a student, aspiring developer, or tech professional, this repository provides a foundational understanding of how clear requirements contribute to project success and client satisfaction.


# What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, gathering, analyzing, and documenting the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a new or modified software system. It is one of the most critical phases in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) because it lays the foundation for everything that follows — from design and development to testing and deployment.

In short, Requirement Analysis acts as the blueprint for software development. Just as architects need a clear design before building a house, developers need a clear set of requirements to build successful software.


# Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Clarifies Expectations: It helps bridge the gap between clients, end users, and developers by ensuring everyone has a shared understanding of what the system should do.

Reduces Development Errors: Clearly defined requirements reduce the chances of building the wrong features or missing key functionalities.

Saves Time and Cost: Catching misunderstandings or missing features early is far less expensive than fixing them later in development.

Improves Project Planning: Accurate requirements allow for better time estimation, resource allocation, and risk management.

Enhances Software Quality: A well-analyzed requirement set leads to a more user-centered, reliable, and maintainable software product.


# Key Activities in Requirement Analysis:

Requirement Gathering: This is the initial step where information is collected from stakeholders (like clients and users) to understand their needs and expectations for the software.

Requirement Elicitation: Collecting needs through interviews, surveys, observation, and stakeholder meetings.

Requirement Documentation: Writing down all requirements in a clear and structured format.

Requirement Analysis and Modelling: In this phase, the gathered requirements are examined for clarity, completeness, and feasibilty. They may be organized into models or diagrams to visualize the system's functionality and flow.

Requirement Validation: his step ensures the requirements are complete, realistic, and agreed upon by all stakeholders. It involves reviewing and confirming the requirements with all parties before development begins.


# Types of Requirements

# Subsection 1

Functional Requirements

Functional requirements define what the system should do. They describe the specific behaviors, features, and functionalities the system must support to meet user needs.

Examples from the Booking Management Project:

Users (customers) can search for hotels based on location, availability, and preferences.

Customers can book a hotel and make payments through third-party payment services.

Hotel managers can log in to their portal to update hotel listings, availability, pricing, and other information.

The system sends booking confirmation notifications to both customers and hotel managers.

Customers and managers can view current and past bookings via the View Booking Service.

The system supports real-time availability updates via messaging queues and data synchronization.


# Subsection 2

Non-functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements define how the system should perform rather than what it should do. These include system attributes like performance, scalability, security, and usability.

Examples from the Booking Management Project:

Scalability: The system uses microservice architecture and load balancers to handle high traffic from users around the world.

Performance: Redis caching is used to reduce database load and speed up API response times.

Availability: The use of replicated (master-slave) databases ensures high availability and reliability of data access.

Security: User access is controlled through separate portals for customers and hotel managers.

Data Consistency: Messaging queues (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) ensure consistent data flow and synchronization between services.

Data Archiving: Cassandra is used to archive old booking data, ensuring the main system remains fast and efficient.

Analytics Support: Integration with Apache Streaming and Hadoop enables big data analysis for business insights.


# Use Case Diagrams

Use Case Diagrams are a type of Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagram used in software development to visually represent the interactions between users (actors) and a system.

They show what the system does from the user's perspective — not how it does it.

In a use case diagram:

Actors represent users or other systems that interact with your application.

Use Cases are actions or services the system performs in response to the actor’s interaction.


Example:

In a hotel booking system, a use case diagram might include:

Actors: Customer, Hotel Manager

Use Cases: Search Hotel, Book Room, Make Payment, Update Hotel Info, View Booking


# Benefits of Use Case Diagrams

Clarity: They provide a clear, visual overview of system functionality from a user’s point of view.

Communication: Help stakeholders (developers, clients, testers) understand system behavior without technical jargon.

Requirement Gathering: Assist in identifying and organizing functional requirements early in the development process.

Scope Definition: Show the boundaries of the system — what’s inside (system responsibility) and what’s external.

Efficient Planning: Help prioritize features and understand user goals during project planning.
